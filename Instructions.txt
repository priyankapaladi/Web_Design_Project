# Basic Workflow

All the data from front-end is routed to the services module and then to the backend (which is in the routes folder). All the user related data can be seen in the authentication.services and authentication.js files. All the blog related data can be seen in the blog.services and blogs.js files.

All the components have their own functionality whose details can be seen their respective component.ts files.

You can also install Robo3T to see the structure of the schema and view the data being saved as and when you use the application.
